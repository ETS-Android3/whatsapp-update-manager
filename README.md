Hi, Most of the people are now switched to FM, YO, GB, Aero and many other modified WhatsApp clients. I don't think it's bad because these clients provide you all the crazy features which I don't think so WhatsApp will even provide you in future that's why we all are using it.

When I started using it I found the issue of updating these Mods because you have to download and install them manually. So after few months, this crazy idea came to my mind "why don't I make an Update manager for WhatsApp, which will download, update these modified WhatsApp clients, have an easy and understandable UI and be less than 10MB?" and that's how WhatsApp Update Manager was born.

After few months of development, we are finally ready to introduce WhatsApp Update Manager to the masses. It has various settings for customization and an easy-to-use interface for a better user experience.
